This program implements the simulated annealing method to solve the floorplaning
problem. 

Firstly, an initial solution will be generated by filling horizontally from node 
1 to node 100. After initial solution, a 100x48 rectangle was filled up and then 
a slicing floorplan tree will be generated. I used the Normalized Polish Expression 
to represent the slicing floorplan tree.

The relative parameters of the annealing process are in the file annealing.h
After annealing, the cost is reduced from 22058 to 22013. A possible reason for 
so small improvement is that the initial solution has been good enough.

To execute the program in a *nix platform, just enter:

$ ./fp -m module.file -n net.file -p pio.file > /dev/null

This will put the debug output to the null file and only dump the annealing 
result.
