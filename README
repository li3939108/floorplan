This program implements the simulated annealing method to solve the floorplaning
problem. 

Firstly, an initial solution will be generated by filling horizontally from node 
1 to node 100. After initial solution, a 100x48 rectangle was filled up. I used 
the Normalized Polish Expression to represent the slicing floorplan tree.
